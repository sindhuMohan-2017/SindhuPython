Strings
=======
* Strings can be enclosed in single quotes('') or double quotes(""). And \ can be used to escape quotes.
 e.g 'Spam eggs' -->out = 'Spam egs'
 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...  -->out = "doesn't"
 "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead -->out = "doesn't"
 '"Yes," they said.'  -->out = '"Yes," they said.'
 '"Isn\'t," they said.'  --> out  = '"Isn\'t," they said.'
 
* The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:
  s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
  s  # without print(), \n is included in the output
    out = 'First line.\nSecond line.'
  print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
  First line.
  Second line.
  
* If you don’t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r before the first quote:
e.g 
   print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
    C:\some
    ame
  print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
   C:\some\name
   
* Comments -->single line comments (#), multi line comments(''' ... ''') or ("""....""")

* Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:
  >>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
  >>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
  'unununium'

* Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated.
    >>> 'Py' 'thon'
    'Python'
  
* This only works with two literals though, not with variables or expressions:
  >>> prefix = 'Py'
  >>> prefix 'thon'  # can't concatenate a variable and a string literal
    File "<stdin>", line 1
      prefix 'thon'
* If you want to concatenate variables or a variable and a literal, use +:
  >>> prefix + 'thon'
  'Python'
  
 String Indexing and Slicing
 ----------------------------
 Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:
  >>> word = 'Python'
  >>> word[0]  # character in position 0
  'P'
  >>> word[5]  # character in position 5
  'n'
Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:
  >>> word[-1]  # last character
  'n'
  >>> word[-2]  # second-last character
  'o'
  >>> word[-6]
  'P'
** Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.

In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain substring:
  >>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
  'Py'
  >>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
  'tho'
Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:
  >>> word[:2] + word[2:]
  'Python'
  >>> word[:4] + word[4:]
  'Python'

Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.
  >>> word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
  'Py'
  >>> word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
  'on'
  >>> word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
  'on'

One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. 
Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example:

       +---+---+---+---+---+---+
       | P | y | t | h | o | n |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6
      -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
      
The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0…6 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. 
The slice from i to j consists of all characters between the edges labeled i and j, respectively.

* Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:
  >>> word[42]  # the word only has 6 characters
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  IndexError: string index out of range

* However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:
  >>> word[4:42]
  'on'
  >>> word[42:]
  ''

* Python strings cannot be changed — they are immutable. Therefore, assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error:
  >>> word[0] = 'J'
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
  >>> word[2:] = 'py'
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
  
* If you need a different string, you should create a new one:
  >>> 'J' + word[1:]
  'Jython'
  >>> word[:2] + 'py'
  'Pypy'
