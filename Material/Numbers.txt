Numbers
=======
* The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float.

operations:
  + Addition  e.g 2+2 =4
  - Subtraction
  * Multipliaction
  / division(results a flaosting point number) e.g 8 / 5 =1.6
  // floor divison(discards the fractional part) e.g 8 // 5 =1
  % modulo(retruns remainder)   e.g 8 % 5 =3
  ** power
  
* The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error
  e.g 
  a) width = 20
  b) Trying to read variable which is not defined
  n  # try to access an undefined variable
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  NameError: name 'n' is not defined
  
* There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to floating point:
  e.g  4 * 3.75 - 1  output = 14.0
  
 * In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _. This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, 
 it is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:
  e.g tax = 12.5 / 100
      price = 100.50
      price * tax   -->out=12.5625
      price + _     -->out=113.0625
      round(_, 2)   -->out=113.06
This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name 
masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.

* In addition to int and float, Python supports other types of numbers, such as Decimal and Fraction. Python also has built-in support for complex numbers, 
and uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part (e.g. 3+5j).
